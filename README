Created for Project 5-1 of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.

This is the Udacity Neightborhood Map Project. This is the Udacity Neighborhood Map Project. \
It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes \
Google Maps.

Included is a list of my favorite spots around Traverse City, Michigan.

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations\
on the map.
